<b><h1>Web Dev</h1></b>
<b><u><h2>Web developer</h2></u></b>
<p>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications 
    using a client-server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS 
    and JavaScript in the client, and any general purpose programming
    language in the server. HTTP is used for communications between client
    and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side
    applications(Front-end web development), server-side applications
    (back-end development), or both(full-stack development).
